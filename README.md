# Gravity gauntlet

## A Game where the main mechanic is gravity

#### Getting started

Windows:
A windows package will be released in the near future to make it easier

Linux:
A prebuilt linux package will be made in the near future so hang thight
Please make sure to have SDL2, some openGL and the address sanitazer packages installed otherwise it won't work
after you've made that sure calling ```$ make -B``` should be fine

#### New features and pull requests
if you found any bugs or improvements be sure to make a pull request
if you want any aditional features to the game open an issue and i'll take a look at wether they are featury enough to
implement (so no unnecessary features sadly)

Updates can come at any time so be sure to update your game every few weeks for the latest changes
